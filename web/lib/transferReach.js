// Both party kinds are Location-grain: a person has to be standing where you
// are and not concealed (web/lib/peopleHere.js#isHere — the one predicate
// every people-picker and every server re-check share), and a Room has to be
// at your Location with its door open for you — the same accessibleRooms()
// predicate the thread-membership sync uses, so the transfer gate and the
// door can never disagree about The Charon.

// The one exception to Location-grain reach: your own faction's silo.
//
// A silo is a Room a faction banks in (Faction.siloRoomId, FACTIONS.md), and
// putting things IN one works from anywhere in that room's zone — you walk
// your loot home to the district, not to the exact door. Taking things OUT
// keeps the ordinary rule, so a silo stays a place somebody has to go, and so
// an occupied storeroom is actually occupied.
//
// Note what this deliberately does NOT check: `accessibleRooms`. Five of the
// silos are locked, and a member without the key can still post goods into
// one — a mail slot. They can never open it, which the deposit control says
// out loud (FactionConsole.js). Refusing the deposit instead would make a
// locked silo useless to everybody but the key-holder.
